\chapter{Glossary of Terms}\label{ch:glossary}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vulnerability}:
      A weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found
      in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a
      negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
      Mitigation of the vulnerabilities in this context typically involves
      coding changes, but could also include specification changes or even
      specification deprecations (e.g., removal of affected protocols or
      functionality in their entirety)
    \item \textbf{Threat}:
      A potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a
      circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and
      cause harm. In this particular scenario we try to anticipate and overcome
      problems from malicious agents (both human and software) intentional or
      unintentional
    \item \textbf{Adversary} (threat agent):
      An entity that attacks, or is a threat to, a system
    \item \textbf{Attack}:
      An assault on system security that derives from an intelligent threat; a
      deliberate attempt to evade security services and violate the security
      policy of a system
    \item \textbf{Countermeasure}:
      An action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a threat, a
      vulnerability, or an attack by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing
      the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that
      corrective action can be taken
    \item \textbf{Risk}:
      An expectation of loss expressed as the probability that a particular
      threat will exploit a particular vulnerability with a particular harmful
      result
    \item \textbf{Security Policy}:
      A set of rules and practices that specify how a system or organization
      provides security services to protect sensitive and critical system
      resources System resource (asset): data, a service provided by a system, a
      system capability, an item of system equipment
