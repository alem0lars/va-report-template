  <%# 1. Personnel involved in the testing from both the Client and Penetration
         Testing Team %>
  The following document was written as a reference for the security
  assessment done by <%= context[:authors].map do |author|
    author[:name]
  end.join(", ") %> towards <%= context[:customer][:name] %> on
  <%= context[:date] %>.

  \section{Assets involved}\label{sec:assets}

    The following assets were involved during the testing activities:

    \begin{itemize}
      <% context[:assets].each do |asset| %>
        <% if asset.key? :description %>
          \item \textbf{<%= asset[:name] %>}: <%= asset[:description] %>
        <% else %>
          \item \textbf{<%= asset[:name] %>}
        <% end %>
      <% end %>
    \end{itemize}

  <%# 5. Scope of Test %>
  \section{Context \& Scope}\label{sec:scope}

    This audit has been carried out at the request of
    <%= context[:customer][:name] %>. Its goal was to evaluate the security of
    the assets under test, as described in section: \nameref{sec:assets}.

    The team has done a \textbf{Black-Box Vulnerability Assessment} and
    \textbf{Penetration Test}.
    No prior knowledge of a company network is known except the endpoints
    mentioned above.
    In essence an example of this is when an external web based test is to be
    carried out and only the details of a website URL or IP address is supplied
    to the testing team.
    It would be their role to attempt to break into the company website or
    network.
    This would equate to an external attack carried out by a malicious hacker.

    The study focuses on main \textbf{Web Vulnerabilities} as described in
    \textbf{OWASP Web Application Penetration Testing Methodology}.

    In particular the following testing areas have been considered:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Configuration and Deployment Management Testing
      \item Identity Management Testing
      \item Authentication Testing
      \item Authorization Testing
      \item Session Management Testing
      \item Input Validation Testing
      \item Error Handling Testing
      \item Cryptography Testing
      \item Business Logic Testing
      \item Client Side Testing
    \end{itemize}
