  \section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology-utilized}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reconnaissance
    \end{itemize}

    The tester would attempt to gather as much information as possible about
    the selected network. Reconnaissance can take two forms i.e.~active and
    passive. A passive attack is always the best starting point as this
    would normally defeat intrusion detection systems and other forms of
    protection etc. afforded to the network. This would usually involve
    trying to discover publicly available information by utilizing a web
    browser and visiting newsgroups etc. An active form would be more
    intrusive and may show up in audit logs and may take the form of an
    attempted DNS zone transfer or a social engineering type of attack.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Enumeration
    \end{itemize}

    The tester would use varied operating system fingerprinting tools to
    determine what hosts are alive on the network and more importantly what
    services and operating systems they are running. Research into these
    services would then be carried out to tailor the test to the discovered
    services.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Scanning
    \end{itemize}

    By use of vulnerability scanners all discovered hosts would be tested
    for vulnerabilities. The result would then be analysed to determine if
    there any vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain access to a
    target host on a network.

  \section{Vulnerability Metrics}\label{sec:vulnerability-metrics}

    The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides an open
    framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT
    vulnerabilities. Its quantitative model ensures repeatable accurate
    measurement while enabling users to see the underlying vulnerability
    characteristics that were used to generate the scores. Thus, CVSS is
    well suited as a standard measurement system for industries,
    organizations, and governments that need accurate and consistent
    vulnerability impact scores.

    CVSS is composed of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and
    Environmental, each consisting of a set of metrics.

    These metric groups are described as follows:

    Base: represents the intrinsic and fundamental characteristics of a
    vulnerability that are constant over time and user environments. Base
    metrics are discussed in Section 2.1.

    Temporal: represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that change
    over time but not among user environments. Temporal metrics are
    discussed in Section 2.2.

    Environmental: represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that
    are relevant and unique to a particular user's environment.
    Environmental metrics are discussed in Section 2.3.

    The purpose of the CVSS base group is to define and communicate the
    fundamental characteristics of a vulnerability. This objective approach
    to characterizing vulnerabilities provides users with a clear and
    intuitive representation of a vulnerability. Users can then invoke the
    temporal and environmental groups to provide contextual information that
    more accurately reflects the risk to their unique environment. This
    allows them to make more informed decisions when trying to mitigate
    risks posed by the vulnerabilities.

    \subsubsection{CVSS v3.0 Ratings}\label{subsec:cvss-v3.0-ratings}

      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabularx}{0.4\textwidth}{c c}
          \toprule
          \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Base Score Range} \\ \midrule
          Low    & 0.0 -- 3.9  \\ \midrule
          Medium & 4.0 -- 6.9  \\ \midrule
          High   & 7.0 -- 10.0 \\
          \bottomrule
        \end{tabularx}
      \end{center}

    \subsection{Metric Groups}\label{subsec:metric-groups}

    \subsection{Base Metrics}\label{subsec:base-metrics}

    The base metric group captures the characteristics of a vulnerability
    that are constant with time and across user environments. The Access
    Vector, Access Complexity, and Authentication metrics capture how the
    vulnerability is accessed and whether or not extra conditions are
    required to exploit it. The three impact metrics measure how a
    vulnerability, if exploited, will directly affect an IT asset, where the
    impacts are independently defined as the degree of loss of
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For example, a
    vulnerability could cause a partial loss of integrity and availability,
    but no loss of confidentiality.

    \subsubsection{Access Vector (AV)}\label{subsec:access-vector-av}

    This metric reflects how the vulnerability is exploited. The possible
    values for this metric are listed below. The more remote an
    attacker can be to attack a host, the greater the vulnerability score.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{Local (L)}: A vulnerability exploitable with only local access
        requires the attacker to have either physical access to the vulnerable
        system or a local (shell) account. Examples of locally exploitable
        vulnerabilities are peripheral attacks such as Firewire/USB DMA
        attacks, and local privilege escalations (e.g., sudo).
      \item
        \textbf{Adjacent Network (A)}: A vulnerability exploitable with
        adjacent network access requires the attacker to have access to either
        the broadcast or collision domain of the vulnerable software. Examples
        of local networks include local IP subnet, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, and
        local Ethernet segment.
      \item
        \textbf{Network (N)}: A vulnerability exploitable with network access
        means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the
        attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a
        vulnerability is often termed ``remotely exploitable''. An example of
        a network attack is an RPC buffer overflow.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Access Complexity (AC)}\label{subsec:access-complexity-ac}

    This metric measures the complexity of the attack required to exploit
    the vulnerability once an attacker has gained access to the target
    system. For example, consider a buffer overflow in an Internet service:
    once the target system is located, the attacker can launch an exploit at
    will.

    Other vulnerabilities, however, may require additional steps in order to
    be exploited. For example, a vulnerability in an email client is only
    exploited after the user downloads and opens a tainted attachment. The
    lower the required complexity, the higher the vulnerability score.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{High (H)} Specialized access conditions exist. For example:

        \begin{itemize}
          \item
            In most configurations, the attacking party must already have
            elevated privileges or spoof additional systems in addition to the
            attacking system (e.g., DNS hijacking).
          \item
            The attack depends on social engineering methods that would be
            easily detected by knowledgeable people. For example, the victim
            must perform several suspicious or atypical actions.
          \item
            The vulnerable configuration is seen very rarely in practice.
          \item
            If a race condition exists, the window is very narrow.
        \end{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{Medium (M)} The access conditions are somewhat specialized;
        the following are examples:

        \begin{itemize}
          \item
            The attacking party is limited to a group of systems or users at
            some level of authorization, possibly untrusted.
          \item
            Some information must be gathered before a successful attack can be
            launched.
          \item
            The affected configuration is non-default, and is not commonly
            configured (e.g., a vulnerability present when a server performs
            user account authentication via a specific scheme, but not present
            for another authentication scheme).
          \item
            The attack requires a small amount of social engineering that might
            occasionally fool cautious users (e.g., phishing attacks that modify
            a web browsers status bar to show a false link, having to be on
            someones buddy list before sending an IM exploit).
        \end{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{Low (L)} Specialized access conditions or extenuating
        circumstances do not exist. The following are examples:

        \begin{itemize}
          \item
            The affected product typically requires access to a wide range of
            systems and users, possibly anonymous and untrusted (e.g.,
            Internet-facing web or mail server).
          \item
            The affected configuration is default or ubiquitous.
          \item
            The attack can be performed manually and requires little skill or
            additional information gathering.
          \item
            The race condition is a lazy one (i.e., it is technically a race but
            easily winnable).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    This metric measures the number of times an attacker must authenticate
    to a target in order to exploit a vulnerability. This metric does not
    gauge the strength or complexity of the authentication process, only
    that an attacker is required to provide credentials before an exploit
    may occur. The fewer authentication instances that are required, the
    higher the vulnerability score.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{Multiple (M)} Exploiting the vulnerability requires that the
        attacker authenticate two or more times, even if the same credentials
        are used each time. An example is an attacker authenticating to an
        operating system in addition to providing credentials to access an
        application hosted on that system.
      \item
        \textbf{Single (S)} The vulnerability requires an attacker to be
        logged into the system (such as at a command line or via a desktop
        session or web interface).
      \item
        \textbf{None (N)} Authentication is not required to exploit the
        vulnerability.
    \end{itemize}

    The metric should be applied based on the authentication the attacker
    requires before launching an attack. For example, if a mail server is
    vulnerable to a command that can be issued before a user authenticates,
    the metric should be scored as ``None'' because the attacker can launch
    the exploit before credentials are required. If the vulnerable command
    is only available after successful authentication, then the
    vulnerability should be scored as ``Single'' or ``Multiple,'' depending
    on how many instances of authentication must occur before issuing the
    command.

    \subsubsection{Confidentiality Impact
    (C)}\label{subsec:confidentiality-impact-c}

    This metric measures the impact on confidentiality of a successfully
    exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information
    access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing
    access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones. Increased
    confidentiality impact increases the vulnerability score.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{None (N)} There is no impact to the confidentiality of the
        system.
      \item
        \textbf{Partial (P)} There is considerable informational disclosure.
        Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not
        have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is
        constrained. An example is a vulnerability that divulges only certain
        tables in a database.
      \item
        \textbf{Complete (C)} There is total information disclosure, resulting
        in all system files being revealed. The attacker is able to read all
        of the system's data (memory, files, etc.)
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Integrity Impact (I)}\label{subsec:integrity-impact-i}

    This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited
    vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and guaranteed
    veracity of information. Increased integrity impact increases the
    vulnerability score.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{None (N)} There is no impact to the integrity of the system.
      \item
        \textbf{Partial (P)} Modification of some system files or information
        is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be
        modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. For
        example, system or application files may be overwritten or modified,
        but either the attacker has no control over which files are affected
        or the attacker can modify files within only a limited context or
        scope.
      \item
        \textbf{Complete (C)} There is a total compromise of system integrity.
        There is a complete loss of system protection, resulting in the entire
        system being compromised. The attacker is able to modify any files on
        the target system.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Availability Impact (A)}\label{subsec:availability-impact-a}

    This metric measures the impact to availability of a successfully
    exploited vulnerability. Availability refers to the accessibility of
    information resources. Attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor
    cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system. Increased
    availability impact increases the vulnerability score.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{None (N)} There is no impact to the availability of the
        system.
      \item
        \textbf{Partial (P)} There is reduced performance or interruptions in
        resource availability. An example is a network-based flood attack that
        permits a limited number of successful connections to an Internet
        service.
      \item
        \textbf{Complete (C)} There is a total shutdown of the affected
        resource. The attacker can render the resource completely unavailable.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Temporal Metrics}\label{subsec:temporal-metrics}

    The threat posed by a vulnerability may change over time. Three such
    factors that CVSS captures are: confirmation of the technical details of
    a vulnerability, the remediation status of the vulnerability, and the
    availability of exploit code or techniques. Since temporal metrics are
    optional they each include a metric value that has no effect on the
    score. This value is used when the user feels the particular metric does
    not apply and wishes to ``skip over'' it.

    \subsubsection{Exploitability (E)}\label{subsec:exploitability-e}

    This metric measures the current state of exploit techniques or code
    availability. Public availability of easy-to-use exploit code increases
    the number of potential attackers by including those who are unskilled,
    thereby increasing the severity of the vulnerability.

    Initially, real-world exploitation may only be theoretical. Publication
    of proof of concept code, functional exploit code, or sufficient
    technical details necessary to exploit the vulnerability may follow.
    Furthermore, the exploit code available may progress from a
    proof-of-concept demonstration to exploit code that is successful in
    exploiting the vulnerability consistently. In severe cases, it may be
    delivered as the payload of a network-based worm or virus. The more
    easily a vulnerability can be exploited, the higher the vulnerability
    score.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{Unproven (U)} No exploit code is available, or an exploit is
        entirely theoretical.
      \item
        \textbf{Proof-of-Concept (POC)} Proof-of-concept exploit code or an
        attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is
        available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations
        and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.
      \item
        \textbf{Functional (F)} Functional exploit code is available. The code
        works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.
      \item
        \textbf{High (H)} Either the vulnerability is exploitable by
        functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual
        trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every
        situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous
        agent (such as a worm or virus).
      \item
        \textbf{Not Defined (ND)} Assigning this value to the metric will not
        influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this
        metric.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Remediation Level (RL)}\label{subsec:remediation-level-rl}

    The remediation level of a vulnerability is an important factor for
    prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially
    published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until
    an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages
    adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency
    as remediation becomes final.The less official and permanent a fix, the
    higher the vulnerability score is.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{Official Fix (OF)} A complete vendor solution is available.
        Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is
        available.
      \item
        \textbf{Temporary Fix (TF)} There is an official but temporary fix
        available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary
        hotfix, tool, or workaround.
      \item
        \textbf{Workaround (W)} There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution
        available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create
        a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise
        mitigate the vulnerability.
      \item
        \textbf{Unavailable (U There)} is either no solution available or it is
        impossible to apply.
      \item
        \textbf{Not Defined (ND)} Assigning this value to the metric will not
        influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this
        metric.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Report Confidence (RC)}\label{subsec:report-confidence-rc}

    This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the
    vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details.
    Sometimes, only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but
    without specific details. The vulnerability may later be corroborated
    and then confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of
    the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a
    vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also
    suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be
    attackers. The possible values for this metric are listed below.
    The more a vulnerability is validated by the vendor or other reputable
    sources, the higher the score.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{Unconfirmed (UC)} There is a single unconfirmed source or
        possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in
        the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from
        the hacker underground.
      \item
        \textbf{Uncorroborated (UR)} There are multiple non-official sources,
        possibly including independent security companies or research
        organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical
        details or some other lingering ambiguity.
      \item
        \textbf{Confirmed (C)} The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the
        vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may
        also be Confirmed when its existence is confirmed from an external
        event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit
        code or widespread exploitation.
      \item
        \textbf{Not Defined (ND)} Assigning this value to the metric will not
        influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this
        metric.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Environmental Metrics}\label{subsec:environmental-metrics}

    Different environments can have an immense bearing on the risk that a
    vulnerability poses to an organization and its stakeholders. The CVSS
    environmental metric group captures the characteristics of a
    vulnerability that are associated with a user's IT environment. Since
    environmental metrics are optional they each include a metric value that
    has no effect on the score. This value is used when the user feels the
    particular metric does not apply and wishes to ``skip over'' it.

    \subsubsection{Collateral Damage Potential
    (CDP)}\label{subsec:collateral-damage-potential-cdp}

    This metric measures the potential for loss of life or physical assets
    through damage or theft of property or equipment. The metric may also
    measure economic loss of productivity or revenue. The possible values
    for this metric are listed below. Naturally, the greater the
    damage potential, the higher the vulnerability score.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{None (N)} There is no potential for loss of life, physical
        assets, productivity or revenue.
      \item
        \textbf{Low (L)} A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result
        in slight physical or property damage. Or, there may be a slight loss
        of revenue or productivity to the organization.
      \item
        \textbf{Low-Medium (LM)} A successful exploit of this vulnerability
        may result in moderate physical or property damage. Or, there may be a
        moderate loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.
      \item
        \textbf{Medium-High (MH)} A successful exploit of this vulnerability
        may result in significant physical or property damage or loss. Or,
        there may be a significant loss of revenue or productivity.
      \item
        \textbf{High (H)} A successful exploit of this vulnerability may
        result in catastrophic physical or property damage and loss. Or, there
        may be a catastrophic loss of revenue or productivity.
      \item
        \textbf{Not Defined (ND)} Assigning this value to the metric will not
        influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this
        metric.
    \end{itemize}

    Clearly, each organization must determine for themselves the precise
    meaning of ``slight, moderate, significant, and catastrophic.''

    \subsubsection{Target Distribution (TD)}\label{subsec:target-distribution-td}

    This metric measures the proportion of vulnerable systems. It is meant
    as an environment-specific indicator in order to approximate the
    percentage of systems that could be affected by the vulnerability. The
    possible values for this metric are listed below. The greater the
    proportion of vulnerable systems, the higher the score.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{None (N)} No target systems exist, or targets are so highly
        specialized that they only exist in a laboratory setting. Effectively
        0\% of the environment is at risk.
      \item
        \textbf{Low (L)} Targets exist inside the environment, but on a small
        scale. Between 1\% - 25\% of the total environment is at risk.
      \item
        \textbf{Medium (M)} Targets exist inside the environment, but on a
        medium scale. Between 26\% - 75\% of the total environment is at risk.
      \item
        \textbf{High (H)} Targets exist inside the environment on a
        considerable scale. Between 76\% - 100\% of the total environment is
        considered at risk.
      \item
        \textbf{Not Defined (ND)} Assigning this value to the metric will not
        influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this
        metric.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Security Requirements (CR, IR, AR)}\label{subsec:security-requirements-cr-ir-ar}

    These metrics enable the analyst to customize the CVSS score depending
    on the importance of the affected IT asset to a users organization,
    measured in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, That
    is, if an IT asset supports a business function for which availability
    is most important, the analyst can assign a greater value to
    availability, relative to confidentiality and integrity. Each security
    requirement has three possible values: low, medium, or high.

    The full effect on the environmental score is determined by the
    corresponding base impact metrics (please note that the base
    confidentiality, integrity and availability impact metrics, themselves,
    are not changed). That is, these metrics modify the environmental score
    by reweighting the (base) confidentiality, integrity, and availability
    impact metrics. For example, the confidentiality impact (C) metric has
    increased weight if the confidentiality requirement (CR) is high.
    Likewise, the confidentiality impact metric has decreased weight if the
    confidentiality requirement is low. The confidentiality impact metric
    weighting is neutral if the confidentiality requirement is medium. This
    same logic is applied to the integrity and availability requirements.

    Note that the confidentiality requirement will not affect the
    environmental score if the (base) confidentiality impact is set to none.
    Also, increasing the confidentiality requirement from medium to high
    will not change the environmental score when the (base) impact metrics
    are set to complete. This is because the impact sub score (part of the
    base score that calculates impact) is already at a maximum value of 10.

    The possible values for the security requirements are listed below. For
    brevity, the same table is used for all three metrics. The greater the
    security requirement, the higher the score (remember that medium is considered
    the default). These metrics will modify the score as much as plus or minus
    2.5.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \textbf{Low (L)} Loss of {[}confidentiality / integrity /
        availability{]} is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the
        organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g.,
        employees, customers).
      \item
        \textbf{Medium (M)} Loss of {[}confidentiality / integrity /
        availability{]} is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the
